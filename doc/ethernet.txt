To wire a LAN8720 Ethernet chip (like the one found on many Ethernet shields) 
to an Arduino Nano, connect the following pins: power (5V and GND) to the 
corresponding Arduino pins, and the data pins (CS, MOSI, MISO, SCK) to the 
designated SPI pins on the Arduino Nano (typically pins 10, 11, 12, and 13); 
remember to also connect the chip select pin (CS) from the LAN8720 to a digital 
pin on the Arduino Nano that you can control in your code to manage 
communication with the Ethernet chip. 

Key points to remember:
Power Supply: Connect the LAN8720's VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V pin and GND to GND. 
SPI Communication:
CS (Chip Select): Connect to a digital pin on the Arduino (usually pin 10). 
MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Connect to Arduino pin 11. 
MISO (Master In Slave Out): Connect to Arduino pin 12. 
SCK (Serial Clock): Connect to Arduino pin 13. 
Important Considerations:
Ethernet Shield:
If using an Ethernet shield with a built-in LAN8720, most of the connections will 
be handled by the shield's design, and you only need to connect the shield's 
designated pins to the Arduino according to the documentation. 
Library:
To use the LAN8720 with your Arduino code, you need to include the appropriate 
Ethernet library in your project.
