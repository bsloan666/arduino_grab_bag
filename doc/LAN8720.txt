On a LAN8720 ethernet board, the pins primarily represent the communication signals for transmitting and receiving data over an Ethernet connection, including power pins, control signals, and the physical data lines (RX and TX) which are differential pairs, meaning they require both a positive and negative signal for proper operation; consult the specific datasheet for your LAN8720 variant for exact pin functions and voltage levels.
Key pin functions on a LAN8720:
Power Pins:
VDD: Power supply voltage for the chip.
GND: Ground connection.
Data Pins (Differential Pairs):
RXP/RXN: Receive data lines (differential pair)
TXP/TXN: Transmit data lines (differential pair)
Control Signals:
nRST: Active-low reset signal
MDC: Management data clock (used for configuration)
MDIO: Management data input/output (used for configuration)
COL: Collision detect signal
CRS: Carrier sense signal
ER: Error signal
100BASE-TX: Indicates 100 Mbps operation
Important points to remember:
Differential signaling:
The data lines (RX and TX) are always differential pairs, meaning you need to connect both the positive and negative signals correctly for proper data transmission.
Datasheet reference:
Always consult the specific datasheet for your LAN8720 variant to get the exact pinout and signal descriptions.
